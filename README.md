# A-B_test_GloBox

## Project Overview

GloBox, an e-commerce company, wants to introduce a new food banner on their website. To assess the impact of this new feature, I conducted an A/B test focusing on key metrics such as average spending and conversion rate. This project is divided into three main stages:

1. **Data Extraction and Visualization**

- Extracted user-level aggregated dataset using SQL.
- Visualized the results in Tableau. [View the dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bekir.mamediiev/viz/project_17056216020770/Dashboard1)
